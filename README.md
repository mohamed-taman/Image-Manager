# Image Management Tool (**IMT**)
An image-based Spring Boot web application that imports images and converts them to different formats, _specifically SVG images to PNG_, with metadata about them for easy search. 
Additionally, you can use the image as an icon for **diagrams** or **architectural diagrams** in presentations or other diagramming applications like [diagrams.io](https://www.drawio.com/)
